            <strong>Hi, I'm Bert Verstraete, a full stack developer and applied informatics student </strong> based in Belgium.
            With a passion for building maintainable and scalable software and products that helps make processes (and life!) easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            I look at challenges with an <strong>adventurous</strong> and <strong>entrepreneurial</strong> mindset,
            constantly broadening my expertise and domain knowledge during hackathons and projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about building software for web, desktop and mobile. I'm typically <strong>language agnostic</strong>, using the right tool for the right job.
            But most often you'll find me writing Java, Golang, Javascript or PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
            In October 2017 I co-founded <strong>LEAP</strong>, a platform with the mission of e-match skill-sets of (young) entrepreneurs
            from different industrial areas to create a synergistic team in order to efficiently create a tangible product
            that can be commercially launched. Although we failed (fast), this experience was invaluable, as I've taken on a leadership role and was presented with many challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my previous internship (Summer 2018) with
            <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Aw20E20kVizrjB" title="Letter of recommendation Teamleader">Teamleader (LOR)</a>
            I learned a lot about <strong>agile</strong> development, writing <strong>SOLID</strong> Object Oriented code and <strong>Domain Driven Design</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next year, starting February 2019, I'll be working for <a href="https://www.zentrick.com">Zentrick</a> as a full stack software engineer in <strong>New York</strong>,
            tackling huge engineering challenges where throughput and latency are key.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, I'm either building cool things, <strong>running</strong> or <strong>climbing</strong> in my local gym.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you have any questions about my work, want to collaborate on a project, or just chat. You can follow me on stuff too, if that's your thing.</p>
