#Reflections CMS

## Genesis
Being a very motivated and driven student, I didn't always have the time to attend the classes.    CMS's aren't really my thing anyways, however I did want to to hone my CSS and designing skills. 
 Turns out this is the perfect assignment for this.
 
 I started out by scouring the web for cool designs, picking out my favourite ones and combining their best features in  terms of design and functionality.  
 
 Following this I made a mockup for the landing page, simple and aesthetically pleasing. Decided not to clutter the landing page too much, by not including blog posts, a huge about me section or previous work experience and projects.

 Very pleased with the look and feel of this first mockup. Didn't make any mockups for the other pages, found this page to be more than enough to base my further design upon.
 Didn't shy away from the details either, sticky header, the right typography, ...
 
 
## Exodus
Then came the time to actually start looking into WordPress. Guided by the lovely [Susan  Simkins](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/wordpress-custom-theme-development/table-of-contents) I started developing the WP theme. 
Starting with the theme details, settings, ect.
